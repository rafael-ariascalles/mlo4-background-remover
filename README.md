Deployment repo for the Background remover


Image segmentation has a lot of amazing applications that solve different computer vision problems. Image segmentation is, essentially, a classification task in which we classify each pixel as belonging to one of the target classes. So when you pass an image through a segmentation model, it will give one label to each of the pixels that present in the image. For this assignment, we'll be checking out background segmentation and replacement of those pixels. Background segmentation is a process in which an algorithm removes the static background from an image. This allows only changing a section of the image. This process is important for motion detection or object tracking.

Change a original image to a new image with a new background.
